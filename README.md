# CopyMirrorBoy
Python Code for calculating highest EV positioning in storybook brawl
Still a WIP but you can mess around with it by changing the TestGB values at the bottom of the file to see whether copycat or good boy is better with Mirror Mirror
I have found that copy cat seems to have higher EV in all situations I have tested thus far.
Formatting for GB is [ATTACK, HEALTH, UPGRADED (1 = no 2 = yes), ATTACK, HEALTH]
The second attack and health get mutated thourought each sample combat and are reset back to the first attack and health values, they should both be the same in the arg.
